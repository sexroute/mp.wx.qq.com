Beautify, unpack or deobfuscate JavaScript and HTML, make JSON/JSONP readable, etc.
All of the source code is completely free and open, available on the github under MIT licence, 
and we have a command-line version, python library and a node package as well.
 
 
 

HTML <style>, <script> formatting:
	 Detect packers and obfuscators? 
 Keep array indentation? 
 Break lines on chained methods? 
 Space before conditional: "if(x)" / "if (x)" 
 Unescape printable chars encoded as \xNN or \uNNNN? 
Use a simple textarea for code input?
